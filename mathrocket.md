Explore euclidean space by programming your rocket with mathematical functions, steering it through asteroid fields, avoiding planets and comets, picking up fuel and lost crewmates, and docking safely at the space station.

# Instant feedback learning

Many kids and adults, especially neurodivergent ones, learn much better when they get **instant feedback**. If you write an answer on your math homework and you get an answer a week later, it will already have left your mind a long time ago. Also it's **boring!**

With Math Rocket, you immediately see the results of your equation. If it's wrong, you'll crash into a rock or end up floating helpless in space. If you're right, you're rewarded. And you can experiment, make adjustment, until you figure it out. You get a more intuitive feeling for what the various functions do and how the different parts of the equation affect one another.
